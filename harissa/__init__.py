Tools for mechanistic gene network inference from single-cell data
------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanistic model-based gene network inference using
a self-consistent proteomic field (SCPF) approximation.
It is analogous to the unrestricted Hartree approximation
in quantum mechanics, applied to gene expression modeled
as a piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP).

The package also includes a simulation module to generate
single-cell data with transcriptional bursting.
